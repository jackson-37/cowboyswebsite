<p id="speech"> "A 3-0 start is a nice beginning, but there's so much season left to play, it can still go one way or another.

So how do you avoid 2008? For one, the locker room has to be as strong as ever. There will be some bad games along the way, but the offensive and defensive leaders have to unite. There can't be egos like the Cowboys had with T.O., who was a great player and very productive, but still prevented the necessary leadership that is a must for teams to be successful."-Nick Eatman, Cowboys Staff Writer</p>
