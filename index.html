<h2 id="bobby">"I'm thrilled, I'm grateful, I'm blessed. I played for the world's greatest professional sports team in history. Once a Dallas Cowboy, always a Dallas Cowboy." -Bob Hayes </h2> 
<p id="believe">	"I believe that this will be one of our best seasons ever. We have a top 5 quarterback with a strong wide receiver core. We have the best running back in the league. We have a top 5 defense with a great D-line. We have all the pieces to a super bowl worthy team this season. We just have to put them together. We have to focus on staying healthy for the whole season, and keep grinding for the playoffs. If we can do this, we have a gauranteed 6th super bowl.<strong> THIS IS THE DREAM TEAM</strong>." -No one

<h2 id="number">Number Six</h2>
<p id="numbersix">"This season will be great. My record prediction is 10-6. We will go to the wild card and win. We will go to the divisional and win. We will go to the NFC Championship and win. We will go the Super Bowl and win if we get lucky. We will add a sixth trophy to that table. We will silence the haters. We will prove to them that we dem boyz."<br><br><strong>-Tony Romo, Master of Predictions</strong></p>
